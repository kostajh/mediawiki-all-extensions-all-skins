== MediaWiki 1.36.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.36 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.36 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.36 upgrades are below:
* MediaWiki 1.36 now requires that the internationalization extension
  (commonly referred to as Intl, ext-intl and php-intl).
* …

For notes on 1.35.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.36 ===
…

==== New configuration ====
* $wgManualRevertSearchRadius – this introduces a new feature that marks edits
  as reverts if they restore the page to an exact previous state. This
  configuration variable sets the maximum number of revisions of a page that
  will be checked against every new edit. Set this to 0 to disable the feature
  entirely.
* $wgOldRevisionParserCacheExpireTime was added, to control caching of
  ParserOutput for old revisions (T244058).
* …

==== Changed configuration ====
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgUseTwoButtonsSearchForm - This setting, deprecated in 1.35, has been
  removed.
* $wgAllowImageMoving - This setting, deprecated in 1.35, has been removed.
  Use group permission settings instead. For example, to prevent sysops
  from moving files, set `$wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['movefile'] = false;`
* $wgExtNewTables, $wgExtNewFields, $wgExtNewIndexes, $wgExtPGNewFields,
  $wgExtPGAlteredFields, $wgExtModifiedFields — These settings were removed.
  They became obsolete after 1.17 overhauled the database updater, but were kept
  for backwards compatibility. The LoadExtensionSchemaUpdates hook should be
  used instead.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.36 ===
* All HTML5 named entities are now accepted in wikitext.
* …

=== New developer features in 1.36 ===
* Parser test files can now declare a dependency on a specific extension
  being loaded, not just on the presence of a certain extension tag hook.
  This is a better fit for extensions like TimedMediaHandler, which affect
  the output but don't register parser hooks.  Use `extension:Foo` in
  the `!! hooks` section of your parser test file to declare a dependency
  on the `Foo` extension being loaded.
* To expose code previously present in SpecialBlock/SpecialUnblock
  to other parts of the code, or to extensions,
  the new BlockUser and UnblockUser command objects were added.
  Use the BlockUserFactory and UnblockUserFactory services to create them.
* The hook UsersPagerDoBatchLookupsHook takes now a \Wikimedia\Rdbms\IDatabase
  instead of \Wikimedia\Rdbms\DBConnRef as first parameter
* MediaHandlers can now customize the formatting of the metadata they emit
  by overriding MediaHandler::formatTag( $key, $value ).  The default for
  unknown tags is numeric formatting; non-EXIF tags which are non-numeric
  should always use this method to specify the desired formatting.
* The new 'title' type can be used to validate action API and REST API inputs.
* …

=== External library changes in 1.36 ===
* …

==== New external libraries ====
* Added pear/net_url2 2.2.2.

  been dropped.
* …

=== Bug fixes in 1.36 ===
* (T190285) ApiEditPage module used to switch 'undo' and 'undoafter' parameters,
  if it founds you reversed them (based on assumption that higher revision ID
  indicates a later revision). The assumption is not always true and is
  hindering proper edit undoing in some cases, hence the logic has been removed.
  Reversing the paramaters will now lead to edit conflict or undefined behavior.
* (T263340) In history merging, pages with a content model that does not support
  redirects will now be recorded as deleted if no revision is being left in the
  source page (that's if all revisions of the page have been merged to another).
* …

=== Action API changes in 1.36 ===
* …

=== Action API internal changes in 1.36 ===
* …

=== Languages updated in 1.36 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* (T245359) Split Bali script locale from "ban" (Balinese) (ban-bali).
* (T259330) Added language support for Mara (mhr).
* (T263968) Added support for Nias language (nia).
* (T264582) Added language support for Madurese (mad).

=== Breaking changes in 1.36 ===
* (T176526) EditPage::getContextTitle() will now throw an exception if a context
  title was not set using setContextTitle(). Previously, this mis-use would only
  cause a deprecation warning to be emitted.
* Multiple methods that fell back to the $wgUser global variable were
  individually hard deprecated previously. The following have now been removed:
  - ApiTestCase::doLogin
  - Article::doDeleteArticle
  - Article::doDeleteArticleReal
  - Article::getComment
  - Article::getCreator
  - Article::getUser
  - Article::getUserText
  - Article::insertProtectNullRevision
  - File::delete
  - File::recordUpload
  - ForeignDBFile::delete
  - ForeignDBFile::recordUpload
  - LocalFile::delete
  - LocalFile::deleteOld
  - LocalFile::recordUpload
  - PageArchive::undelete
  - RecentChange::markPatrolled
  - Title::getUserPermissionsErrors
  - Title::quickUserCan
  - Title::userCan
  - WebRequest::getLimitOffset
  - WikiPage::doDeleteArticle
  - WikiPage::insertProtectNullRevision
  - All methods of the old SpecialPageFactory; the entire class was removed
* Multiple methods previously had optional User parameters, with fallbacks
  to the $wgUser global variable. Not passing a User to those methods was
  previously hard deprecated, and support for not passing a User has now
  been removed:
   - ArchivedFile::userCan
   - File::userCan
   - FileDeleteForm::__construct
   - FileDeleteForm::doDelete
   - LocalFileDeleteBatch::__construct
   - LogEventsList::getExcludeClause (only needed for the 'user' audience)
   - LogEventsList::userCan
   - LogEventsList::userCanBitfield
   - LogEventsList::userCanViewLogType
   - LogPage::addEntry (also accepts user id instead)
   - OldLocalFile::userCan
   - PatrolLog::record
   - Title::getNotificationTimestamp (though the entire method is deprecated)
   - WikiPage::getComment (only needed for the FOR_THIS_USER audience)
   - WikiPage::getCreator (only needed for the FOR_THIS_USER audience)
   - WikiPage::getUser (only needed for the FOR_THIS_USER audience)
   - WikiPage::getUserText (only needed for the FOR_THIS_USER audience)
* The following hooks have been removed:
   - APIQueryInfoTokens
   - APIQueryRecentChangesTokens
   - APIQueryRevisionsTokens
   - APIQueryUsersTokens
   - ApiTokensGetTokenTypes
* LogEventsList::typeAction previously accepted an optional right parameter,
  and checked if the context user ($wgUser) had that right. Passing a right
  was hard deprecated in 1.35, and support for passing a right has now been
  removed.
* WikiPage::doDeleteArticleReal previously accepted an optional user as its
  fifth parameter, and fell back to $wgUser if not user was provided. The
  signature changed to have the user as the second parameter, and the old
  signature was hard deprecated in 1.35. Support for the old signature has
  now been removed.
* User::addNewUserLogEntry, deprecated since 1.27, was removed.
* As part of refactoring the EditPage class, EditPage::setPreloadedContent,
  which had no known callers was removed entirely. Additionally, the
  following public methods were made private:
  - ::extractSectionTitle
  - ::getSummaryInputWidget
  - ::noSuchSectionPage
  - ::initialiseForm
* The global function `wfWaitForSlaves`, deprecated in 1.27 and hard-deprecated
  in 1.35, has been removed. Use LBFactory::waitForReplication() instead.
* The global variable $wgMemc, deprecated since 1.35, has been removed.
  Usage should generally be migrated to WANObjectCache, or if you really need
  the internal object, use ObjectCache::getLocalClusterInstance instead.
* CategoryFinder, which was deprecated in 1.31 and hard-deprecated in 1.35,
  has been removed.
* Sanitizer::escapeId(), deprecated in 1.30, has been removed.
* Parser::setFunctionTagHook(), deprecated in 1.35, has been removed.
* The ParserBeforeTidy hook, deprecated in 1.35, has been removed.
* The ParserBeforeTidy, ParserBeforeStrip, and ParserAfterStrip hooks,
  deprecated in 1.35, have been removed.
* All methods of MWTidy except for MW::tidy() have been removed.  These
  were either @internal or deprecated in 1.35.
* The support for IE8 has been dropped.
* (T248062) Mixins `.background-image-svg()` and `.background-image-svg-quick()`
  (provided by mediawiki.mixins.less), which have been deprecated since 1.35,
  have now been removed. MediaWiki no longer supports any browser which would
  require this SVG-fallback PNG support, so you can simply use the regular CSS
  `background-image:` declaration instead.
* The ResourceLoader module `mediawiki.legacy.oldshared` and its file
  'oldshared.css', deprecated since 1.35 has been removed (T248357).
* The LinkBegin and LinkEnd hooks, deprecated in 1.28, have been removed. You
  can instead use the HtmlPageLinkRendererBegin and HtmlPageLinkRendererEnd
  hooks, respectively.
* Skin::getDynamicStylesheetQuery(), deprecated in 1.32, has been removed. You
  should use action=raw&ctype=text/css directly.
* Skin::makeI18nUrl(), deprecated in 1.35, has been removed.
* The following User methods, deprecated and moved to BlockManager in 1.34,
  were removed: isDnsBlacklisted, inDnsBlacklist, isLocallyBlockedProxy,
  trackBlockWithCookie.
* Support for v1 of the parser tests file format has been removed; it was
  deprecated in 1.35. (T174199)
* SpecialUnblockUser::processUIUnblock() has a different return
  value (previously, array of messages or a boolean value, now,
  a Status object). This function was also marked as @internal and is no
  longer safe to call it publicly.
* mw.Title.getDotExtension() from the 'mediawiki.Title' module was removed
  without deprecation. You should use mw.Title.getExtension() and prepend
  the dot if need be.
* Profiler::getTemplated and Profiler::setTemplated, deprecated in 1.34,
  have been removed.
* Removed HookContainer::getOriginalHooksForTest() without deprecation.
  This method was introduced in 1.35 for internal use, and appears unused
  outside of MediaWiki core.
* ParserCache::__construct() now requires three parameters.
* Message->getFormat(), deprecated in 1.29, has been removed.
* Support for passing Article to ParserCache::get, deprecated in 1.35,
  has been removed.
* ParserCache::singleton(), deprecated in 1.30, has been removed.
* DatabaseBlock::deleteIfExpired and ::fromMaster, deprecated in 1.35, have been
  removed.
* AbstractBlock::prevents, deprecated in 1.33, has been removed.
* AbstractBlock::shouldTrackWithCookie, deprecated in 1.34, has been removed.
* AbstractBlock::getBlocker, ::setBlocker, and ::getBlockErrorParams,
  deprecated in 1.35, have been removed.
* Multiple DatabaseBlock methods dealing with cookies, deprecated in 1.34,
  have been removed:
  - ::setCookie
  - ::clearCookie
  - ::getCookieValue
  - ::getIdFromCookieValue
  - ::shouldTrackWithCookie
* The public static callback function SpecialUnblock::processUIUnblock has been
  removed. This method was for internal use only, and appears unused outside of
  MediaWiki core.
* ChangeTags::truncateTagDescription, deprecated in 1.35, has been removed.
* Deprecated null fallbacks in PasswordReset constructor have been removed.
* User::isEveryoneAllowed and User::getAllRights, deprecated in 1.34, has been
  removed.
* The following methods of the UserGroupMembership class, deprecated in 1.35,
  has been removed:
  - ::initFromRow
  - ::newFromRow - use UserGroupManager::newGroupMembershipFromRow
  - ::selectFields - use UserGroupManager::getQueryInfo
  - ::delete - use UserGroupManager::removeUserFromGroup
  - ::insert - use UserGroupManager::addUserToGroup
  - ::purgeExpired - use UserGroupManager::purgeExpired
  - ::getMembershipsForUser - use UserGroupManager::getUserGroupMemberships
  - ::getMembership - use UserGroupManager::getUserGroupMemberships
* The public static callback function SpecialBlock::validateTargetField has been
  removed. This method was for internal use only, and appears unused outside of
  MediaWiki core.
* The public static callback function SpecialUploadStash::tryClearStashedUploads
  has been removed. This method was for internal use only, and appears unused
  outside of MediaWiki core.
* SpecialComparePages::showDiff() ::revOrTitle(), ::checkExistingTitle(),
  and ::checkExistingRevision() were marked as @internal to allow for
  breaking changes. They are no longer safe to call. The methods were
  unused outside of MediaWiki core.
* Special pages provided by core now using service injection via constructor.
  When extending a special page the call to grandparent constructor
  ("SpecialPage::__construct()") in the sub class breaks the extension special
  page, because the fallback code in the parent constructor cannot set the
  services as needed. Be sure to call the parent constructor when extending
  core special pages. The extending of core special pages is not part of the
  stable interface and should be avoided.
* Language::getExtraUserToggles and ::viewPrevNext, deprecated in 1.34, have
  been removed.
* StreamFile::send404Message and ::parseRange, deprecated in 1.34, have been
  removed.
* SVGMetadataExtractor class, deprecated in 1.34, has been removed.
* ProcessCacheLRU class, deprecated in 1.32, has been removed.
* wfForeignMemcKey(), deprecated in 1.35, has been removed.
* LoadBalancer::safeWaitForMasterPos(), deprecated in 1.34, has been removed.
* ApiFeedRecentChanges::getFeedObject has been changed to private, and appears
  unused outside of MediaWiki core.
* Skin::subPageSubtitle() has been changed to private method. Callers should
  use Skin::prepareSubtitle().
* wfForeignMemcKey() and wfMemcKey(), deprecated in 1.35, have been removed.
* MediaWiki now also requires the php-intl extension.
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.36 ===
* LocalFile::recordUpload2, soft deprecated in 1.35, now emits deprecation
  warnings. Use ::recordUpload3 instead.
* The User class, which was marked as @newable in 1.35, is no longer newable,
  meaning that it is no longer safe to manually call the constructor via
  `new User`. Instead, use the UserFactory service.
* Use of the `preprocessor=Preprocessor_DOM` option in parser test files has
  been deprecated.  Preprocessor_DOM was removed in 1.35.
* ParserOptions::setTidy() has been deprecated.  It has had no effect since
  1.35.
* Sanitizer::escapeIdReferenceList() has been deprecated; it will eventually
  be made private to the class, as it appears to have no uses outside the
  Sanitizer class.
* Sanitizer::hackDocType() is deprecated; it will eventually be made private.
* Skin::getIndicatorsHTML() is deprecated. The functionality can be retained
  by reimplementing the method using the raw indicators data from
  OutputPage::getIndicators.
* Skin::makeVariablesScript() has been deprecated. Use
  ResourceLoader::makeInlineScript() instead.
* The PageProps class was converted to a service. PageProps::overrideInstance
  was deprecated, and MediaWikiServices::redefineService should be used
  instead.
* Title::nameOf() is deprecated; use Title::newFromID()->getPrefixedDBkey()
  instead.
* DatabaseBlock::insert, DatabaseBlock::update, DatabaseBlock::purgeExpired and
  DatabaseBlock::delete are deprecated. Use DatabaseBlockStore::insertBlock,
  DatabaseBlockStore::updateBlock, DatabaseBlockStore::purgeExpiredBlocks and
  DatabaseBlockStore::deleteBlock instead.
* SpecialBlock::getTargetAndType is deprecated. Call AbstractBlock::parseTarget
  directly instead.
* SpecialUnblock::processUnblock was deprecated - use UnblockUserFactory
  service instead.
* Deprecated MediaWikiIntegrationtestCase::removeTemporaryHook() in favor of
  MediaWikiIntegrationtestCase::clearHook().
* Skin::getSearchLink(), also exposed as 'searchaction' option in SkinTemplate,
  has been deprecated. Use Title or SpecialPage methods directly.
* Skin::getAllowedSkins and ::getSkinNames have been deprecated. Use their
  respective equivalents in SkinFactory instead.
* The RollbackComplete hook has been deprecated, use the PageSaveComplete hook
  instead.
* Skin::makeUrl() has been deprecated. Title methods should be used instead.
* Skin::privacyLink(), Skin::disclaimerLink() and Skin::aboutLink() have been
  deprecated. Please use Skin::footerLink() instead.
* Skin::getLogo() has been deprecated. Use ResourceLoaderSkinModule instead.
* Skin::mainPageLink() has been deprecated. Use LinkRenderer service instead.
* BaseTemplate::getToolbox() method has been hard deprecated. The toolbox data
  is now available in a sidebar data array which you can get from any class
  that's extending QuickTemplate class.
* Constructing a DefaultPreferencesFactory, LinkHolderArray or PasswordReset
  without a $hookContainer parameter is deprecated.
* Autopromote class, soft deprecated since 1.35, now emits deprecation warnings.
  Use UserGroupManager instead.
* SpecialBlock::canBlockEmail has been deprecated. Please use
  BlockPermissionChecker::checkEmailPermissions instead.
* SpecialBlock::checkUnblockSelf has been deprecated. Please use
  BlockPermissionChecker::checkBlockPermissions instead.
* SpecialBlock::parseExpiryInput was deprecated - use
  BlockUser::parseExpiryInput instead.
* SpecialBlock::validateTarget has been deprecated, use BlockUtils instead.
* SpecialBlock::validateTargetField has been deprecated for external use,
  use BlockUtils instead.
* SpecialPage::getLanguageConverter has been deprecated, use
  LanguageConverterFactory::getLanguageConverter() directly.
* ParserCache::getKey has been deprecated. Use ParserCache::getMetadata and
  ParserCache::makeParserOutputKey instead.
* The PHPUnit4And6Compat class, used to provide compatibility with PHPUnit 4,
  was removed. MediaWiki support for PHPUnit 4 ended with the removal of HHVM
  support.
* The PHPUnit6And8Compat class, used to provide compatibility with PHPUnit 6,
  was removed without deprecation. This class was introduced during the
  upgrade to PHPUnit 8, but never used.
* ParserCache::getETag has been deprecated, instead build suitable etag
  explicitly.
* The following functions from the Language class have been hard deprecated
  and will be removed in a subsequent release:
   - findVariantLink
   - convertTitle
   - updateConversionTable
   - commafy
* The mw.language.commafy client-side method has been deprecated, to match
  the deprecation of Language::commafy.  Use mw.language.convertNumber
  instead.
* Title::isDeleted() and Title::isDeletedQuick() have been deprecated. Please
  use Title::getDeletedEditsCount() and Title::hasDeletedEdits() instead.
* Article::getContentObject, soft-deprecated since 1.32, was hard-deprecated.
* WikiRevision::importUpload, soft-deprecated since 1.31, was hard-deprecated.
* Html::infoBox() has been deprecated. There's no replacement.

* …

=== Other changes in 1.36 ===
* The 'tidy' key in ParserOptions (used in the parser cache) has been removed.
  It has had no effect since 1.35.
* A future release of MediaWiki will make {{=}} a built-in parser function,
  for use when automatically escaping the `=` character in template arguments.
  A tracking category and parser warning have been added to this release when
  {{=}} is used and it expands to something other than `=`.
* The implementation of TestFileReader::read has been changed to use
  Parsoid's parser test file parser.  This should be compatible with
  existing code, but it only supports version 2 of the test file
  specification and may be more strict when parsing invalid input,
  including duplicate tests.
* The SkinLessImportPaths attribute was added, allowing skins to add a
  directory to the import path for LESS stylesheets. Skins can use this
  to provide a custom version of mediawiki.skin.variables.less, setting
  skin-specific values for certain LESS variables.
* The interaction between ContentHandler::getParserOutputForIndexing()
  and ContentHandler::getDataForSearchIndex() has been clarified
  (the latter should only be called with the result of the former).
  Extensions may override getParserOutputForIndexing() to skip generating HTML,
  which may improve indexing performance. (The default implementation
  still generates HTML, and getDataForSearchIndex() implementations can still
  rely on it if they do not override getParserOutputForIndexing().)
* Article::fetchContentObject, ::mContentObject, ::mContentLoaded,
  ::mRevIdFetched, deprecated since 1.32, were removed.
* Article::mParserOptions and ::setParserOptions were removed.
* Article and ImagePage::getEmptyPageParserOutput, unused, were removed.
* All public properties of CacheTime and ParserOutput classes, as well as
  declaring properties dynamically on these classes were deprecated. Use
  appropriate getters/setters instead.
